# Product Context: Teams and Roles Management System

## Why This System Exists

The Teams and Roles Management System addresses critical business needs in ProptyOS:

### 1. **Security & Compliance**
- **Problem**: Uncontrolled access to sensitive financial and client data
- **Solution**: Granular permission system ensuring users only access what they need
- **Business Value**: Reduced risk of data breaches and compliance violations

### 2. **Team Collaboration**
- **Problem**: Difficulty managing multiple team members with different access needs
- **Solution**: Role-based access with easy invitation and management
- **Business Value**: Faster team onboarding and better collaboration

### 3. **Audit & Accountability**
- **Problem**: No tracking of who made changes or accessed sensitive data
- **Solution**: Comprehensive activity logging with full audit trail
- **Business Value**: Better accountability and easier troubleshooting

### 4. **Scalability**
- **Problem**: Manual permission management doesn't scale with team growth
- **Solution**: Automated role assignment and permission inheritance
- **Business Value**: Reduced administrative overhead as company grows

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow

1. **Company Admin Setup**
   - Company admin creates initial roles (or uses defaults)
   - Defines permissions for each role based on business needs
   - Sets up team structure and access levels

2. **Team Member Onboarding**
   - Admin invites new team member via email
   - Assigns appropriate role with specific permissions
   - Team member receives invitation and sets up account
   - Automatic permission assignment based on role

3. **Daily Operations**
   - Users access only modules they have permission for
   - Permission checks happen automatically on every action
   - All activities are logged for audit purposes
   - Role changes take effect immediately

4. **Management & Monitoring**
   - Admins can view all team members and their roles
   - Activity logs show who did what and when
   - Permission changes are tracked and auditable
   - Easy role modification and user reassignment
