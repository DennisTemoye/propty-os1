# Project Brief: Teams and Roles Management System

## Project Overview

Implement a comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) solution integrated into ProptyOS, providing granular permissions management, team member administration, and comprehensive activity logging for enhanced security and user management.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Role-Based Access Control
- Implement 14 modules with 4 permission levels (view, create, edit, delete)
- Create role hierarchy: Admin, Manager, User, and Custom role levels
- Set up default roles for new companies
- Implement permission inheritance system

### 2. Team Member Management
- Build secure invitation system for new team members
- Enable role assignment and modification
- Track invitation, pending, active, and inactive states
- Ensure complete data separation between companies

### 3. Activity Logging
- Implement comprehensive tracking of all system activities
- Create complete audit trail with filtering and search
- Optimize performance with proper indexing

### 4. Security Features
- Integrate with existing JWT authentication
- Implement company context isolation
- Add permission validation middleware
- Ensure comprehensive input validation

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components
- Extend existing roles components in `src/components/dashboard/roles/`
- Enhance `TeamRoles.tsx` with full functionality
- Create new permission management interfaces
- Implement activity logging dashboard

### Backend Integration
- Extend existing API services in `src/services/`
- Add new endpoints for roles, team members, and activity logs
- Implement permission validation middleware
- Create comprehensive error handling

### Data Models
- Define TypeScript interfaces for roles, team members, and activity logs
- Extend existing types in `src/types/`
- Ensure compatibility with current authentication system

## Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**: All 14 modules have proper permission controls
2. **Security**: Company data isolation and permission validation working
3. **Performance**: Activity logs and queries optimized with proper indexing
4. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing ProptyOS components
5. **User Experience**: Intuitive role and permission management interface

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Core types and interfaces
2. **Phase 2**: API services and endpoints
3. **Phase 3**: Frontend components and UI
4. **Phase 4**: Permission middleware and validation
5. **Phase 5**: Testing and optimization

## Dependencies

- Existing ProptyOS authentication system
- Current API service infrastructure
- React components and UI library
- TypeScript type system
