# Active Context: Teams and Roles Management System Implementation

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Goal**: Implement the comprehensive Teams and Roles Management System for ProptyOS according to the specification in `README-teams-roles.md`

**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation (Types and Interfaces)

**Immediate Tasks**:
1. Create core TypeScript interfaces for roles, team members, and activity logs
2. Extend existing API constants with new endpoints
3. Implement core services for role and team management
4. Create permission validation middleware

## Recent Changes

### Project Analysis Completed
- ✅ Analyzed existing project structure and components
- ✅ Identified existing role-related components in `src/components/dashboard/roles/`
- ✅ Reviewed current authentication and API service architecture
- ✅ Documented current technology stack and dependencies

### Memory Bank Initialized
- ✅ Created `.cursor/core/projectbrief.md` - Project overview and requirements
- ✅ Created `.cursor/core/productContext.md` - Business context and user stories
- ✅ Created `.cursor/core/systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and design patterns
- ✅ Created `.cursor/core/techContext.md` - Technology stack and implementation details

## Current Implementation State

### What's Already Working
- **Existing Components**: Basic role management UI components exist
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth system is functional
- **API Service**: Centralized API service with middleware chain
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS setup
- **State Management**: React Query for server state management

### What Needs to Be Built
- **Type Definitions**: Complete TypeScript interfaces for the RBAC system
- **API Services**: Service classes for roles, team members, and activity logs
- **Permission Middleware**: Middleware for validating user permissions
- **Enhanced Components**: Full-featured role and permission management UI
- **Activity Logging**: Comprehensive system for tracking user actions

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. **Type System Design**
- **Decision**: Extend existing types in `src/types/` rather than creating new files
- **Rationale**: Maintains consistency with current project structure
- **Consideration**: Need to ensure backward compatibility with existing types

### 2. **API Endpoint Structure**
- **Decision**: Follow existing API pattern with company context
- **Rationale**: Consistent with current authentication and company isolation
- **Consideration**: Need to extend `API_ENDPOINTS` constant properly

### 3. **Component Architecture**
- **Decision**: Enhance existing role components rather than rebuild
- **Rationale**: Faster implementation and better integration
- **Consideration**: May need significant refactoring of existing components

### 4. **Permission System Design**
- **Decision**: Implement 14 modules with 4 permission levels
- **Rationale**: Matches specification requirements exactly
- **Consideration**: Need to ensure scalability and performance

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### 1. **File Organization**
- Keep related functionality together (types, services, components)
- Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for files, PascalCase for components)
- Maintain clear separation between UI and business logic

### 2. **Error Handling**
- Use existing `ApiResponse` and `ApiError` patterns
- Implement comprehensive validation with Zod schemas
- Provide user-friendly error messages

### 3. **State Management**
- Use React Query for server state
- Keep local state minimal and focused
- Implement optimistic updates where appropriate

### 4. **Performance**
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Optimize re-renders with React.memo and useMemo

## Learnings and Project Insights

### 1. **Existing Architecture Strengths**
- Well-organized component structure with clear separation
- Comprehensive API service with middleware support
- Good use of TypeScript for type safety
- Consistent UI patterns with Shadcn/ui

### 2. **Integration Opportunities**
- Existing authentication system can be extended
- Current API service pattern is well-designed
- Dashboard layout system is flexible and extensible

### 3. **Potential Challenges**
- Need to ensure backward compatibility
- Permission system must integrate seamlessly with existing components
- Activity logging needs to be performant at scale

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 2-3 hours)
1. **Create Core Types**: Implement TypeScript interfaces for roles, team members, and activity logs
2. **Extend API Constants**: Add new endpoints to `API_ENDPOINTS`
3. **Implement Core Services**: Create service classes for role and team management
4. **Add Permission Middleware**: Implement middleware for permission validation

### Short Term (Next 1-2 days)
1. **Enhance Existing Components**: Update role management components with new functionality
2. **Implement Permission UI**: Create permission management interface
3. **Add Activity Logging**: Implement activity tracking and display
4. **Integration Testing**: Test integration with existing components

### Medium Term (Next 1 week)
1. **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching and optimization strategies
2. **Security Hardening**: Add additional security measures and validation
3. **User Experience**: Polish UI and add advanced features
4. **Documentation**: Complete implementation documentation

## Current Blockers and Dependencies

### No Current Blockers
- All required dependencies are available
- Existing architecture is well-suited for the implementation
- Clear specification and requirements available

### Dependencies
- Existing authentication system must remain functional
- Current API service patterns must be maintained
- Existing components should continue to work

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- Follow existing TypeScript patterns and conventions
- Maintain consistent error handling and validation
- Use proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Follow existing component patterns and structure

### Performance
- Ensure permission checks are fast and efficient
- Implement proper caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize database queries and API calls
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders

### Security
- Implement proper permission validation on all endpoints
- Ensure company data isolation is maintained
- Log all security-relevant activities
- Validate all user inputs and permissions

## Success Criteria for Current Phase

### Phase 1 Completion Criteria
- ✅ All core TypeScript interfaces are defined and working
- ✅ API endpoints are properly configured and accessible
- ✅ Core services can perform basic CRUD operations
- ✅ Permission middleware can validate basic permissions
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] TypeScript compilation without errors
- [ ] API endpoints return proper responses
- [ ] Services can create, read, update, and delete data
- [ ] Permission middleware blocks unauthorized access
- [ ] Existing components continue to function
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
